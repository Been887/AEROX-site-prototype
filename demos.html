                    which was very helpful, but I found hard as someone who was inexperienced at Onshape.<br><br>
                    
                    It's a good idea to make a few practice cars to get the hang of it, for the final 
                    car to be modelled well. This pro class season (my first pro class year), I made a total of 7 cars using onshape, each one more refined than the last.
                    If your car model breaks - it suggests you should follow more CAD tutorials/learn the CAD 
                    better so you're more fluent with design and therefore can design a car more accurately to spec.

                    This web page shows the development of AEROX's car, but also serves as a good skills builder
                    with CADs so you can learn how to do the same.<br>
                </p>    

                <h2>Stage 1 - The Body</h2>
                <div style="width: 50%; left: 60%; float: right;">
                    <img style="width: 80%" src="resources/Logs/body intersection.PNG"/>
                </div>

                <p><strong>a good way to create a functional body </strong>(basic shape to start with) is by intersecting a sideon and topdown sketch.<br>
                    You should aim for your sketches to fit the season's regs with machining tolerances.
                    A good way to do this from the sketch is to use derived features using a context. This is 
                    done by right clicking the part in it's assembly and selecting edit in context (also using something 
                    from that context keeps it).<br>


                    
                    Also (it may seem obvious) but after all this CAD modelling, remember to integrate aerodynamics into your car.
                    A good model for this would be to accelerate the air around the sidepod and taper it back smoothly
                    to avoid rear wheel and direct into main air channel, or you could just block flow with a big sidepod.<br><br>

                    Using an intersection is a good idea to make the body because it makes a fairly complex
                    shape while keeping it easily machinable (from a foam block).<br>
                </p>

                <h2>Stage 2 - The Rear Body</h2>
                <p><strong>canister holding loft section - </strong> it's essential to use tapered shapes 
                    and add as little frontal surface area as possible, while adding mounts 
                    for components including rear pod and wings - I did this by cutting the rear loft to have standoffs 
                    from which you can mount printed parts.<br>

                    The most common way to make the canister holder is to loft from a surface (typically back of the halo)
                    to a circle which encases the required 18mm-18.5mm canister diameter at the time of making this.
                    The canister wall must meet thickness, so thinking ahead for this component is crucial.<br>
                    To get a more streamlined and aesthetic shape, i used weighted surface normals for the loft to 
                    act like a spline curve.   <br><br>
                    
                    <strong>Rear wing - </strong>for this part, it's better to have a neutral, thin foil (wing face from the side)
                    since you don't need any traction and therefore downforce.<br><br>
                    To make any wings, a good method is to use Sweeps, where you create a foil sketch and a path (starting at the same point)
                    and then carry the foil along the path to make a solid.
