                <p>
                    I learned how to design STEM Racing cars by following the

                    I think it's definitely a good idea to make a few practice cars to learn how and get the hang of it, for the final 
                    car to be modelled well. In my pro class season, I made a total of 7 cars using onshape, each one more refined than the last.
                    E.g. if the geometries and parametric features break (beyond fixing) due to a bad variable etc, it's better to make another 
                    model and use the CAD more, before your model becomes perfect and you never break the cad again.<br><br>

                    This web page shows the development of my car, how I did it, and how you can too.<br>

                <h2>Stage 1 - the body</h2>
                <div style="width: 50%; left: 60%; float: right;">
                    <img style="width: 80%" src="resources/Logs/body intersection.png"/>
                </div>

                <p>
                    As mentioned earlier, the body is usually made with an intersection, this makes a fairly complex shape while 
                    keeping it machinable (since the car must be CNCd from a foam block). A topdown and sideon extrusion is best, 
                    but you should still experiment with other techniques.<br><br>


                </p>

                <h2>Making Sketches</h2>
                <p>
                    Sketches can be a bit hard to grasp at first, but once you learn constraints and parametric features they become very useful.<br>

                    the most common constraints include > 
                    <li>horizontal/vertical - constraints vertices or a line to be horizontal or vertical (depending on which you choose)</li>
                    <li>dimension - constrains a distance between 2 vertices, a dimension of something </li>
                </p>

                <p>
                    <strong>This is only basic and other techniques are shared in other logs e.g.</strong>
                    <li>Designing the Car</li>
                    <li>Designing the Wind Tunnel</li>
                    although, the definitions are still included in the def search.

                <h2>How I Learned CAD</h2>
                <p>
                    <em>Please note - it's more effective short term to choose a CAD for what you need than to learn all of the open source ones first (even thought it's extra knowledge).</em><br><br>

                    <strong>Blender ></strong>
                    In year 7, I found animation interesting and thought that mastering Blender would be great for designing in "F1 in schools" (now callled STEM Racing) which had just been introduced to our school at the time. It was not.<br>
                    Blender is amazing for renders, but took me a long time to learn fully, only realise it wasn't the right tool due to lack of technicality and no parametric features.<br>
                    Blender is meshed/topology based, and although proportional editing is nice, and the render features (which i used for car renders) are amazing, it's made for displaying rather than designing.<br><br>

                    <strong>TinkerCAD ></strong>
                    After making a car using Blender, I wanted to discover the features of a 'real CAD', which were supposedly much better.
                    TinkerCAD, for me, was an infuriating development process that i got nowhere with even after months of learning. I found that the lack of tools along with a UI/navigation too different to blender hindered me, and left the team before my blender-designed car raced in entry class. This doesn't mean TinkerCAD is useless, just it wasn't for me.<br><br>

                    <strong>FreeCAD ></strong>
                    Making a re-arrival for Pro-Class, I decided parametric was the way to go after reading up on CADs. Since i prefered local apps for offline development, and fusion 360 wanted my full name, address and others for a student license, I chose the open source alternative;<br>
                    FreeCAD is easier to get the hang of than Onshape, but Onshape is more polished. It does have some strangely named features like changing extrude to 'pad', but is effective and allowed me to learn the basics of CAD.
                    after running into limitations with the fillet tool, extreme lag and crashes, losing hours of progress in total (possibly due to outdated school hardware), the switch I needed seemed obvious.<br><br>

                    <strong>Onshape ></strong>
                    If my team hadn't encouraged me to use onshape, i probably would've chosen another local CAD which likely isn't much better than FreeCAD. Learning Onshape was almost as challenging as Blender without any prior knowledge, especially with my experience of FreeCAD's function names.<br>
                    assemblies had me confused for a while - as nobody knew what one was or how it worked. Even though there is slight lag to onshape, the navigation is customisable, and cloud based nature allowed seamless transitions to windows for CFD or FEM testing.<br>

                <p>
                    Depending on what you aim for e.g. <a href="#definitions">parametric</a> or not, the criteria changes massively.<br>

                    <strong>Parametric Modelers help with > <br> </strong>
                </p>

                <li>iteration - repeating changes until correct</li>
                <li>Keeping up to date - if you change an operation, everything after it will change accordingly</li>
                <li>Linking everything - You can make measurement variables, universal variables, and use other bodies etc as references etc</li>

                <li>Fusion 360 (parametric mode)</li><br>


                <p><strong>Direct Modelers help with > </strong></p>

                <li>Loading times - after a lot of operations/features, actions etc can become sluggish in parametric, especially in web based CADs. Direct has less things to load every operation.</li>
                <li>Static copies - sometimes you want to copy something and edit it, this is hard because most parametric CADs only allow exact unmodified "derived" copies. Direct allows things to be done without any interference</li>
                <li>Topologies/barebones - it is very rare for a parametric modeler to allow direct surface editing e.g. delete this vertice, only uses given operations, Direct can often change the surface very <em>directly</em>.</li>
